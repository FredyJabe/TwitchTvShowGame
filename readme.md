# Twitch TV Show Game
Let's start with a special thanks to [Deinoka](https://www.twitch.tv/deinoka) for his request for this tool!

## What does it do?
The Twitch TV Show Game is a tool free to use by streamers to host the equivalent of TV Game shows with their viewers!

### Want to contribute?
Feel free to open Issues and Pull Requests if you see something wrong, I did that mostly as a learning experience to experiment with JavaScript.


Thank you for your interest and have fun hosting TV Shows! If you do a special event using this tool, feel free to hit me up either here of on discord so I can come by and say hi!
